# Frozen Garden

Frozen Garden is a collection of simple recursive descent parsers that allow the user to convert a language into psuedocode and flowcharts

The software is split into two main segments, the front-end, which converts to an intermediate XML-style representation, and the back-end, which converts the intermediate code to pseudocode.

The software is designed this way, as it allows the software to be modified for any new languages which may want to be added in the future.
